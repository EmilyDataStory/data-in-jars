# My Projects

## [Predicting Rental Prices (Regression Models)](https://github.com/EmilyDataStory/airbnb-mel-price)
This project builds a predictive model for Airbnb prices in Melbourne, using property, host, and location data to identify key factors associated with rental pricing. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, it provides actionable insights for hosts and investors to optimise pricing strategies for sustainable income.

## [Diabetes Risk Prediction (Classification Models)](https://github.com/EmilyDataStory/diabetes-risk-prediction):
Explore how machine learning can be leveraged to predict diabetes risk using non-invasive health indicators. 
This project not only tackles a critical public health issue but also demonstrates transferable data science skills such as data preprocessing, model optimisation, and insightful visualisation that are valuable across various industries.

## [Employee Attrition Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/EmilyDataStory/employee-attrition-eda):
In this project, I use Python to explore factors influencing workforce turnover in a dataset of 1,470 employees. 
Through data visualiaation and statistical analysis, I uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention strategies. 
Check out the detailed EDA notebook in this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/EmilyDataStory/employee-attrition-eda).
